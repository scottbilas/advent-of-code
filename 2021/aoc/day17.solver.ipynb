    "You finally decode the Elves' message. HI, the message says. You continue searching for the sleigh keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahead of you is what appears to be a large ocean trench. Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial x,y velocity like 0,10 would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like 10,-1 would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probe's x position increases by its x velocity.\n",
    "- The probe's y position increases by its y velocity.\n",
    "- Due to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.\n",
    "- Due to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step. The submarine computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    target area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5\n",
    "\n",
    "This target area means that you need to find initial x,y velocity values such that after any step, the probe's x position is at least 20 and at most 30, and the probe's y position is at least -10 and at most -5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this target area, one initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is 7,2:\n",
