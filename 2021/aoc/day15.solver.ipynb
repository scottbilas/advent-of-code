    "You've almost reached the exit of the cave, but the walls are getting closer together. Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main problem is that the walls of the cave are covered in chitons, and it would be best not to bump any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling, restricting your motion to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of risk level throughout the cave (your puzzle input). For example:\n",

    "You start in the top left position, your destination is the bottom right position, and you cannot move diagonally. The number at each position is its risk level; to determine the total risk of an entire path, add up the risk levels of each position you enter (that is, don't count the risk level of your starting position unless you enter it; leaving it adds no risk to your total).\n",

Your original map tile repeats to the right and downward; each time the tile repeats to the right or downward, all of its risk levels are 1 higher than the tile immediately up or left of it. However, risk levels above 9 wrap back around to 1. So, if your original map had some position with a risk level of 8, then that same position on each of the 25 total tiles would be as follows:\n",
