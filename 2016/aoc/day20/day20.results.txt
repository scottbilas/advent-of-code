--- Day 20: Firewall Rules ---

   You'd like to set up a small hidden computer here so you can use it to get
   back into the network later. However, the corporate firewall only allows
   communication with certain external [16]IP addresses.

   You've retrieved the list of blocked IPs from the firewall, but the list
   seems to be messy and poorly maintained, and it's not clear which IPs are
   allowed. Also, rather than being written in [17]dot-decimal notation, they
   are written as plain [18]32-bit integers, which can have any value from 0
   through 4294967295, inclusive.

   For example, suppose only the values 0 through 9 were valid, and that you
   retrieved the following blacklist:

 5-8
 0-2
 4-7

   The blacklist specifies ranges of IPs (inclusive of both the start and end
   value) that are not allowed. Then, the only IPs that this firewall allows
   are 3 and 9, since those are the only numbers not in any range.

   Given the list of blocked IPs you retrieved from the firewall (your puzzle
   input), what is the lowest-valued IP that is not blocked?

   Your puzzle answer was 19449262.

--- Part Two ---

   How many IPs are allowed by the blacklist?

   Your puzzle answer was 119.

   Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **

   At this point, you should [19]return to your Advent calendar and try another
   puzzle.
