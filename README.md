# Advent of Code

These are my [Advent of Code](www.adventofcode.com) solutions.

Setup:

* Get Scoop: `iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex`
* Add buckets: `scoop bucket add extras`
* Get support: `scoop install tesseract linqpad graphviz`
* Get [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/)

All solutions can be validated by running tests from Rider.

## TODOS

* Test Coverage
* Rearrange code, it's just a pile
* Simplify/unity position/rect/Int2/3/etc
* NPath needs ChangeFilename including lambda form for doing a replace/append/etc.
* Tests for above
* Expando or sparse grid?
* Pathfinding on expando and sparse grid
* Make a set of nunit tests that demo various tricks like pathfinding and grid printing and flood filling
* Safety exceptions inside of grid.totext
* WOuld be nice to fix obj output location to temp just like bin..have to do directory.props or whatever
